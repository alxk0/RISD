							<br>NOTES
							<br><br>Makes 6 parfaits.
							<br><br>Serves 4.
							<br><br>INGREDIENTS
							<br><br>¾ &nbsp cup milk
							<br>½ &nbsp vanilla bean, scraped
							<br>5 &nbsp T butter, room temperature
							<br>½ &nbsp cup plus 3 T sugar
							<br>3 &nbsp T flour
							<br>2 &nbsp egg yolks
							<br>⅔ &nbsp cup water
							<br>1 &nbsp T kirsch
							<br>1 &nbsp loaf vanilla pound cake
							<br>3.5 oz. almond paste
							<br>1 &nbsp lb. strawberries, trimmed
							<br><br>
						</div>
						<div class="b">
							<br>METHOD
							<br><br>1. Make The Crème Mousseline. In a saucepan, heat the milk, vanilla seeds and half of the butter, until the butter is melted. In a bowl, add 3 T sugar, the flour and egg yolks, and whisk in 1⁄4 of the milk mixture, then pour back into the saucepan. Bring to a boil, whisking, and cook for 1 minute. Transfer to a shallow dish and apply plastic wrap directly onto the mixture. Let cool. Transfer to a bowl and blend in the remaining butter. Chill.
							<br><br>2. Make The Syrup. In a small saucepan, combine the water, 1⁄2 cup sugar and kirsch, and bring to a boil. Cook for 3 minutes and chill.
							<br><br>3. Assemble The Parfaits. Cut the pound cake into one-inch-thick slices and punch out 12 circles using a rocks glass. Roll the almond paste into a thin layer and cut 6 circles with the glass; set aside. Push 1 disk of pound cake down into each glass and spoon 1 T of the syrup over the top. Line the sides with halved strawberries, pressing them against the glass. Spoon 1⁄4 cup crème mousseline into each glass. Arrange 4 or 5 strawberry halves in the center and top with mousseline, covering the berries. Add a second disk of pound cake to each glass and spoon on 2 T syrup. Top with the almond paste disk and garnish with powdered sugar and thinly sliced strawberries.

							<br>NOTES
							<br><br>Serves 6.
							<br><br>INGREDIENTS
							<br><br>2 &nbsp vanilla beans
							<br>500 grams milk
							<br>500 grams heavy cream
							<br>150 grams sugar
							<br>160 grams glucose
							<br>240 grams egg yolks
							<br>10 &nbspgrams skim milk powder
							<br>2.5 grams carob flour
							<br>40 &nbspgrams unsalted butter, cut into cubes
						</div>
						<div class="b">
							<br>METHOD
							<br><br>1. Cut the vanilla beans in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with a knife. In a large bowl, combine the vanilla seeds and beans with the milk.
							<br><br>2. In a saucepan, bring the cream, sugar, glucose, and the milk mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally, approximately 15 minutes.
							<br><br>3. Once the mixture comes to a boil, remove it from the heat, pour a few splashes of the hot cream mixture into a bowl with the egg yolks, and stir well. Continue to add small amounts of the hot cream mixture into the egg yolks and stir until the egg mixture slowly becomes warm.
							<br><br>4. Once the egg mixture is warm, pour the rest of the hot cream mixture in.
							<br><br>5. Transfer to a Thermomix and blend in the milk powder, carob flour, and butter.
							<br><br>6. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve set over a small bowl.
							<br><br>7. Freeze the ice cream mixture in 2 Paco beakers for at least 24 hours until completely frozen, then process in the Pacojet. (Note you will have more ice cream than you need for this recipe.)
