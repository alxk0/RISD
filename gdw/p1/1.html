						<br>NOTES
						<br><br>Serves 6-8.
						<br><br>INGREDIENTS
						<br><br>
						6 &nbsp slices bacon, cut into lardons<br>
						3 &nbsp 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br>
						3 &nbsp pounds stewing beef, cut into 2-inch chunks<br>
						1 &nbsp large carrot, sliced<br>
						1 &nbsp large white onion, sliced<br>
						1 &nbsp pinch coarse salt and freshly ground pepper<br>
						2 &nbsp tablespoons all-purpose flour<br>
						3 &nbsp cups red wine, like a chianti<br>
						2 1/2 to 3 1/2 cups beef stock<br>
						1 &nbsp tablespoon tomato paste<br>
						2 &nbsp cloves smashed garlic<br>
						½ &nbsp thyme<br>
						1 &nbsp crumbled bay leaf<br>
						1 &nbsp small pearl onions<br>
						18-24 tablespoons butter<br>
						1 &nbsp herb bouquet (4 sprigs parsley, 2 sprigs thyme, 1 bay leaf)
					</div>
					<div class="b">
						<br>METHOD
						<br><br>1. Simmer bacon lardons in 4 cups water for 10 minutes (Lardon is the French culinary term referring to thin strips of bacon, cut approximately 1/4-inch thick). Drain and pat dry.
						<br><br>2. Preheat oven to 450°F. In a large Dutch oven, sautÃ© the bacon in 1 tablespoon of oil for about 3 minutes, until it starts to lightly brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
						<br><br>3. Dry the beef with a few paper towels for better browning. In batches, sear the beef on all sides in the Dutch oven. Set aside with the bacon.
						<br><br>4. Back in the pot, add the sliced carrots and onions; sauté in fat until browned, about 3 minutes. If there's any excess fat, drain it now.
						<br><br>5. Add the bacon and beef back to the pot. Season with 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt and 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper. Toss. Sprinkle with flour and toss once more. Place in the center of the oven for 4 minutes.
						<br><br>6. Remove pot from oven; toss beef and place back in the oven for 4 more minutes. Remove the pot from the oven and reduce the heat to 325°F.
						<br><br>7. To the pot, add the wine and stock. The liquid should barely cover the meat and vegetables. Add the tomato paste, garlic and thyme. Bring to a light simmer on the stove, then cover and simmer in the lower part of the oven for 3 to 4 hours, or until the meat is easily pierced.
						<br><br>8. In the last hour of cooking, bring 1 1/2 tablespoons butter and 2 teaspoons oil to a medium heat in a sauté pan. Add the pearl onions and toss around in the fat until they've browned, 10 minutes. Then stir in 1/2 cup beef stock, a small pinch of salt and pepper and the herb bouquet. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the onions for about 40 minutes, until the liquid has evaporated, and the onions are tender.
						<br><br>9. Remove the onions and set aside. Discard the herb bouquet and wipe out the skillet. Add the remaining butter and oil and bring to a medium heat.
						<br><br>10. Add the mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes, shaking the pan to coat with the butter.
						<br><br>11. Place a colander over a large pot. Drain the beef stew through the colander and into the pot. Place the pot with the sauce over a medium heat and simmer for about 5 minutes, skimming any fat on top. Pour the beef and vegetables back into the Dutch oven. Add the pearl onions and mushrooms to the pot. Pour the sauce over the beef mix and simmer an additional 3 to 5 minutes.

						<br>NOTES
						<br><br>Serves 4.
						<br><br>INGREDIENTS
						<br><br>2 &nbsp &nbsp x 400 g beef fillets
						<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp olive oil, for frying
						<br>500 &nbsp g mixture of wild mushrooms, cleaned
						<br>1 &nbsp &nbsp thyme sprig, leaves only
						<br>500 &nbsp g puff pastry
						<br>8 &nbsp &nbsp slices of Parma ham
						<br>2 &nbsp &nbsp egg yolks, beaten with 1 tbsp water and a pinch of salt
						<br>&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
						<br><br>For the red wine sauce
						<br><br>2 &nbsp &nbsp tbsp olive oil
						<br>200 &nbsp g beef trimmings
						<br>4 &nbsp &nbsp large shallots, peeled and sliced
						<br>12 &nbsp &nbspblack peppercorns
						<br>1 &nbsp &nbsp bay leaf
						<br>1 &nbsp &nbsp thyme sprig
						<br>1 &nbsp &nbsp splash of red wine vinegar
						<br>1 &nbsp &nbsp x 750ml bottle red wine
						<br>750 &nbsp ml beef stock
					</div>
					<div class="b">
						<br>METHOD
						<br><br>1. Wrap each piece of beef tightly in a triple layer of cling film to set its shape, then chill overnight.
						<br><br>2. Remove the cling film, then quickly sear the beef fillets in a hot pan with a little olive oil for 30-60 seconds until browned all over and rare in the middle. Remove from the pan and leave to cool.
						<br><br>3. Finely chop the mushrooms and fry in a hot pan with a little olive oil, the thyme leaves and some seasoning. When the mushrooms begin to release their juices, continue to cook over a high heat for about 10 minutes until all the excess moisture has evaporated and you are left with a mushroom paste (known as a duxelle). Remove the duxelle from the pan and leave to cool.
						<br><br>4. Cut the pastry in half, place on a lightly floured surface and roll each piece into a rectangle large enough to envelop one of the beef fillets. Chill in the refrigerator.
						<br><br>5. Lay a large sheet of cling film on a work surface and place 4 slices of Parma ham in the middle, overlapping them slightly, to create a square. Spread half the duxelle evenly over the ham.
						<br><br>6. Season the beef fillets, then place them on top of the mushroom-covered ham. Using the cling film, roll the Parma ham over the beef, then roll and tie the cling film to get a nice, evenly thick log. Repeat this step with the other beef fillet, then chill for at least 30 minutes.
						<br><br>7. Brush the pastry with the egg wash. Remove the cling film from the beef, then wrap the pastry around each ham-wrapped fillet. Trim the pastry and brush all over with the egg wash. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes.
						<br><br>8. Meanwhile, make the red wine sauce. Heat the oil in a large pan, then fry the beef trimmings for a few minutes until browned on all sides. Stir in the shallots with the peppercorns, bay and thyme and continue to cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the shallots turn golden brown.
						<br><br>9. Pour in the vinegar and let it bubble for a few minutes until almost dry. Now add the wine and boil until almost completely reduced. Add the stock and bring to the boil again. Lower the heat and simmer gently for 1 hour, removing any scum from the surface of the sauce, until you have the desired consistency. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve lined with muslin. Check for seasoning and set aside.
						<br><br>10. When you are ready to cook the beef wellingtons, score the pastry lightly and brush with the egg wash again, then bake at 200°C/Gas 6 for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and cooked. Rest for 10 minutes before carving.
						<br><br>11. Meanwhile, reheat the sauce. Serve the beef wellingtons sliced, with the sauce as an accompaniment.

						<br>NOTES
						<br><br>Take 4 ½ hours. Serves 6.
						<br><br>INGREDIENTS
						<br><br>For the broth
						<br><br>4 &nbsp bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (675g total)
						<br>2 &nbsp small carrots, cut into (3 cm) lengths
						<br>200 g negi or spring onions, cut into 3 cm lengths
						<br>2 &nbsp cm piece fresh ginger, thinly sliced crosswise
						<br>1 &nbsp tsp flaky sea salt
						<br>2 &nbsp tbsp gold sesame oil
						<br> &nbsp  &nbsp brown rice miso or soy sauce, for flavouring
						<br><br>For the noodles
						<br><br>300 g plain flour, plus more for sprinkling
						<br>2 &nbsp tbsp gold sesame oil
						<br>2 &nbsp whole eggs, plus 2 yolks, at room temperature
						<br><br>For the toppings
						<br><br>200 g greens, such as komatsuna, bok choy, or spinach, blanched, squeezed, and chopped
						<br>3 &nbsp Tbsp finely chopped negi or spring onions
						<br>3 &nbsp eggs, at room temperature, boiled for 8 mins, refreshed, peeled, and halved lengthwise
						<br>1 &nbsp sheet nori, cut into sixths
						<br>&nbsp &nbsp rayu (chilli oil), optional
						<br>&nbsp &nbsp shichimi togarashi (seven-spice powder)
					</div>
					<div class="b">
						<br>METHOD
						<br><br>1. For the broth: preheat the oven to 230°C, fan 210°C, gas 8. Toss the chicken, carrots, negi, and ginger with the salt. Rub with the sesame oil and arrange in an oven dish. Roast for 35 mins, until nicely browned.
						<br><br>2. Tip the chicken and veg into a large pot and add 4 ltr cold water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, and cook, covered, for 1 hr.
						<br><br>3. Remove the chicken and shred the meat into a bowl. Wet the meat with a scoop of broth. Return the bones to the pot and continue simmering, uncovered, for 30 mins. Strain into a clean pot and discard the bones and veg.
						<br><br>4. Meanwhile, make the noodles. Place the flour in a large bowl and drizzle in the sesame oil. Mix with your fingers until pebbly. Make a well and break in the whole eggs and yolks. Mix with your fingers until the eggs and flour are incorporated, but the dough is crumbly. Turn out onto a work surface and knead until smooth and pliable (about 5 mins). Let the dough rest for at least 30 mins.
						<br><br>5. Roll out the dough using a seimenki [noodle machine] or Italian pasta machine. Cut into thin noodles, approximately 3mm wide. Cut into 22cm lengths using a pizza cutter. Sprinkle with flour and toss to prevent sticking, but keep the noodles aligned.
						<br><br>6. Fill a large pot three-quarters full of water and bring to a boil over high heat.
						<br><br>7. Bring the broth to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce it to low. Prepare 6 large donburi [deep soup bowls], measuring in your choice of flavouring: 2 tbsp miso or 4 tsp soy sauce per bowl . Whisk 4 tbsp broth into each bowl to emulsify the flavouring.
						<br><br>8. Add the noodles to the boiling water and cook for 2 mins. While the noodles are cooking, add about 350ml broth into each bowl and whisk to combine with the flavouring liquid.
						<br><br>9. Drain the noodles and divide the noodles among the bowls. Working quickly (so the broth does not cool), keeping each ingredient in its own area, add 2 heaped tbsp chicken meat, 2 heaped tbsp greens, ½ tbsp negi, an egg half, and a small piece of nori. If desired, add spice with rayu (for soy sauce ramen) or shichimi togarashi (for miso ramen).

						<br>NOTES
						<br><br>Cook’s note: Tomatoes: For this dish it’s important that the tomatoes are of the very best quality. If you are making this dish in the late summer/early fall months when tomatoes are ripe and in season, fresh, ripe Roma tomatoes are ideal. If not, substitute with the best quality canned San Marzano tomatoes you can find. Use two (28-ounce) cans of whole peeled San Marzano (D.O.P) tomatoes, drained and cut into halves or quarters as a substitute for the fresh tomatoes in this dish.
						<br><br>Lamb: This is a rustic dish made from leftovers. It can be made from a combination of leftover cooked lamb combined with raw lamb, or solely raw lamb. The leg of lamb used in this dish was roasted, but lamb (from the leg or shoulder) cooked simply any way will do; it could be grilled, roasted or braised. Roughly 2 ½ pounds of raw lamb will equal approximately 1 ¼ pounds cooked. The raw portion of lamb used in this dish is the very tender lamb flank. In American Butchery cuts, it’s connected to the saddle, but a call to your butcher should get you the right cut. The lamb flank can have a great deal of fat; be sure to trim away excessive amounts, leaving some in for flavor and texture.
						<br><br>Take 4 ½ hours. Serves 6.
						<br><br>INGREDIENTS
						<br><br>For the chickpeas
						<br><br>1 &nbsp c (6.25 ounces) picked over dry chickpeas
						<br>&nbsp &nbsp salt
						<br><br>For the cooked tomatoes
						<br><br>14 &nbspwhole small roma tomatoes, (2 ¼ pounds) (or substitute whole peeled canned tomatoes – see cook’s note)
						<br>&nbsp &nbsp ice for ice bath
						<br>&nbsp &nbsp salt
						<br><br>For the soup
						<br><br>¼ &nbsp cup extra virgin olive oil
						<br>2 &nbsp medium red onions, peeled and cut into 1-inch wedges (about 3 cups)
						<br>5 &nbsp medium carrots, scrubbed, and cut into 1-inch half moon pieces (about 3 cups)
						<br>7 &nbsp small turnips, scrubbed and cut into 1-inch wedges (about 3 cups)
						<br>5 &nbsp whole garlic cloves, peeled Sea salt, to taste Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
						<br>¼ &nbsp pounds cooked leg of lamb, cut into bite-sized pieces, (see cook’s note)
						<br>2¾ &nbsppounds lamb flank, trimmed of excess fat and cubed, (see cook’s note)
						<br>1½ &nbsptablespoons ground cumin
						<br>1 &nbsp tablespoon ground turmeric
						<br>&nbsp &nbsp pinch habanero chile powder or cayenne powder, or to taste
						<br>2 &nbsp tablespoons tomato paste
						<br>5 &nbsp small whole preserved lemons, seeded and chopped, (about 1 cup)
						<br>2 &nbsp stalks of celery, cut crosswise into ½-inch slices
						<br>1 &nbsp tablespoon coriander seeds
						<br>1 &nbsp tablespoon celery seeds
						<br>1 &nbsp tablespoon fennel seeds
						<br>1 &nbsp tablespoon cumin seeds
						<br>3 &nbsp quarts (48 ounces) white chicken stock or low sodium chicken broth
						<br>2 &nbsp cups mixed fresh cilantro and mint (picked leaves), plus more for serving
						<br>2 &nbsp stalks celery, sliced thin (1 cup)
						<br>2 &nbsp small preserved lemons, seeded and chopped (1/2 cup)
						<br>2 &nbsp large lemons, juiced (1/2 cup)
						<br>&nbsp &nbsp large lemons cut into wedges, for serving 
						<br>&nbsp &nbsp crusty bread, for serving
						<br><br>
					</div>
					<div class="b">
						<br>METHOD
						<br><br>1.Cover the chickpeas by at least 2 inches of water and soak overnight in the refrigerator.
						<br><br>2. Change the water and add the chickpeas to a large pot with enough water to cover the chickpeas by 1 inch. Bring the water to a simmer, about 10 minutes. Skim off any foam. Top off with (1 cup) more water to cool off the liquid. Reduce heat to medium-low. Bring to a slow simmer again, skim off any foam, and add more water (1 cup). Repeat this process 2-3 more times to slowly cook the chickpeas until they are soft and creamy, about 1 ½ to 2 hours. Season with salt. Measure out 1 ½ cups of cooked chickpeas and set aside for use in the Chorba. Store the remaining chickpeas in the refrigerator for another use.
						<br><br>3. For the tomatoes. Note: If using canned tomatoes, the following process is not necessary, simply halve or quarter the canned tomatoes and reserve for use in the Chorba. Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Using a pairing knife, make an “x” on the bottom of each tomato, cutting just through the skin. Prepare an ice bath in a large bowl.
						<br><br>4. Working in batches, carefully drop the tomatoes into the boiling water and let cook for 1-2 minutes. Remove and transfer to the ice bath to cool.
						<br><br>5. When cool, peel the skin from the tomatoes using a pairing knife and discard. Pat the tomatoes dry and spread out on a rimmed baking sheet and lightly season with salt. Slowly roast the tomatoes for 2 hours, then set aside to let cool.
						<br><br>6. Quarter the tomatoes lengthwise. Set aside for use in the Chorba
						<br><br>7. For the soup. In a large wide heavy bottomed pot (a large Dutch oven or a rondeau), heat the oil over medium-high heat (2 to 3 min) and add the onions, carrots, turnips and sauté for 6 to 8 minutes until just beginning to soften.
						<br><br>8. Add the meat and garlic to the vegetables in the pot and stir to combine. Brown the meat lightly, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes. Coat the meat and vegetables with the cumin and turmeric and season with salt and pepper. Stir and toast the spices for a minute until fragrant. Stir in tomato paste and cook for another minute. Then add the reserved tomatoes and chickpeas, the preserved lemon and the celery. Add the remaining spices: coriander seeds, celery seeds, fennel seed and cumin seeds. Top with the white chicken stock and water to cover about one-inch above the meat.
						<br><br>9. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Cook uncovered for 1 ½ to 2 hours until the meat and vegetables are tender and the flavors have melded, adding additional water as needed to maintain a soupy consistency. Remove and discard the garlic. Remove from heat. Adjust seasonings.
						<br><br>10. Stir in the fresh herbs, preserved lemons, sliced celery and freshly squeezed lemon juice. Serve immediately with the additional herbs, lemon wedges and crusty bread at the table.

						<br>¾ &nbsp tsp potato flour
						<br>1 &nbsp tsp dark soy sauce
						<br>1 &nbsp tsp light soy sauce tsp chinkiang vinegar
						<br>3 &nbsp tsp sesame oil
						<br>1 &nbsp Tbsp chicken stock or water
						<br><br>
					</div>
					<div class="b">
						<br>METHOD
						<br><br>1. Cut the chicken as evenly as possible into 1cm strips and then into small cubes. Mix with the marinade ingredients.
						<br><br>2. Peel and thinly slice the garlic and ginger, and chop the spring onions into Icm (1/2 inch) chunks. Snip the chillies into 1.5cm (3/4 inch) sections, discarding seeds as far as possible. Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl
						<br><br>3. Pour a little groundnut oil into the wok and heat until it smokes, swirling the oil around to cover the entire base of the wok. Pour off into a heatproof container. Add 3 tbsp fresh oil and heat over a high flame. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the chillies and Sichuan pepper and stir-fry for a few seconds until they are fragrant (take care not to burn them).
						<br><br>4. Add the chicken and continue to stir-fry. When the chicken cubes have separated, add the ginger, garlic and spring onions and stir-fry until they are fragrant and the meat is just cooked.
						<br><br>5. Give the sauce a stir and add to the wok, continuing to stir and toss. As soon as the sauce has become thick and lustrous, add the peanuts, mix them in, and serve immediately.

			<hr><button class="accordion"><div>+ GRAVLAX</div></button>
			<div class="panel"><div class="txt">
					<div></div>
					<div>
						<br>NOTES
						<br><br>The name of the dish itself comes from the Swedish word meaning ‘to bury’. This refers back to the original gravlax, which was just salted and buried in the ground to ferment before being eaten. The use of white pepper and dill as aromatics, which is completely dominating gravlax recipes today, started in the eighteenth century, but before that the fish was probably not seasoned at all, except by the cure itself.
						<br><br>INGREDIENTS
						<br><br>2¼ &nbsppounds salmon fillet, skin on, pin bones removed and patted dry
						<br>4 &nbsp salt
						<br>4 &nbsp sugar
						<br>20 &nbspwhite peppercorns, coarsely crushed
						<br>1 &nbsp bunch dill, stalks and fronds separated
					</div>
					<div class="b">
						<br>METHOD
						<br><br>1. Remove the pin bones from a clean and evenly thick piece of fish fillet. Rub it all over with a mixture of salt, sugar and aromatics. I like to store the fish and the curing mix in a plastic bag, which makes it easy to keep the whole surface of the fish in contact with the cure, ensuring an even result. When the fish is thoroughly coated, place it in its bag on a tray and set a few plates on top to weight it down a little (or use something else flat and suitably heavy). Transfer it to the refrigerator to cure for the required length of time.
						<br><br>2. I like to cure the salmon for about 24 hours before washing off the cure mix. To stop the cure, take the fish out of the bag and either rinse it quickly under cold running water or scrape the cure and seasonings off it. Transfer the fish to a new plastic bag, place it back on the tray and return it to the refrigerator. This allows the cure to even out within the fish. Leave it for about the same length of time as it was in the curing mix.
						<br><br>3. The fish can be served straight away or after only a short rest, but it will appear more cured on the surface than in the middle. Fish prepared this way is either cut straight down, at a 90-degree angle relative to the chopping (cutting) board, in slightly thicker slices of 4 to 5 mm (1/8 to 1/4 inch) or else it is cut at a 45-degree angle into very thin and much larger slices.

						<br>NOTES
						<br><br>Cơm gà Hải Nam. Serves 4-6 as a main course.
						<br><br>INGREDIENTS
						<br><br>For the chicken
						<br><br>1 &nbsp whole high quality chicken (about 31/2 pounds)
						<br>5 &nbsp quarter-sized slices ginger, peeled or unpeeled, crushed with the broad side of a cleaver or chef's knife
						<br>½ &nbsp medium yellow onion, sliced
						<br>2 &nbsp teaspoons salt
						<br>1 &nbsp tablespoon fish sauce
						<br><br>For the rice
						<br><br>2 &nbsp cups raw long-grain rice, such as Thai jasmine
						<br>4 &nbsp tablespoons chicken fat (take from poaching liquid) or peanut oil
						<br>1½ &nbsptablespoons finely chopped garlic
						<br>1 &nbsp tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger
						<br>1 &nbsp tablespoon finely chopped shallot
						<br>4 &nbsp fresh or thawed pandan leaves, tied together in one loose knot (optional)
						<br>&nbsp  &nbsp salt, to taste
						<br><br>Sauce option 1: Ginger sauce
						<br><br>2 &nbsp inch chubby section ginger (about 2 ounces), peeled and thinly sliced
						<br>1½ &nbsptablespoons peanut oil
						<br>¼ &nbsp teaspoon salt
						<br><br>Sauce option 2: Singapore chili sauce
						<br><br>2-3 large red chiles, such as Fresno, cayenne, or long chile, coarsely chopped
						<br>2-3 hot Thai chiles, coarsely chopped
						<br>1 &nbsp teaspoon finely chopped garlic
						<br>1½ &nbspteaspoons finely chopped fresh ginger
						<br>½ &nbsp teaspoon sugar
						<br>¼ &nbsp teaspoon salt
						<br>1 &nbsp tablespoon fresh lime juice
						<br>1 &nbsp tablespoon hot chicken poaching broth
						<br><br>Sauce option 3: Sweet Soy Sauce
						<br><br>1 &nbsp tablespoon light (regular) soy sauce
						<br>1 &nbsp tablespoon dark soy sauce
						<br>1½ &nbspteaspoons unseasoned rice vinegar
						<br>1 &nbsp tablespoon sugar
						<br>½ &nbsp teaspoon Asian chili sauce, such as Sriracha
						<br><br>Garnishes
						<br><br>1 &nbsp english cucumber, peeled, seeded and thinly sliced tomato, thinly sliced or cut into wedges
						<br>4-5 sprigs cilantro, coarsely chopped
						<br><br>
					</div>
					<div class="b">
						<br>METHOD
						<br><br>1. Rinse and pat the chicken dry with paper towel. Cut off the head, neck, wing tips and feet - extraneous parts that are on your chicken. Use a heavy cleaver to cut the neck and wings into halves or thirds. Aim to cut through the bone. Set aside.
						<br><br>2. Select a pot that the chicken snugly fits into with about an inch clearance between the top of breast and the edge of the pot. Fill it halfway with water and add the extraneous parts that you just cut up, along with the ginger, onion, and salt. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat and add the chicken.
						<br><br>When the pot returns to a boil, lower the heat to gently simmer. Bubbles should softly dance at the surface. Basing your cooking time on the chicken's original weight, poach for 10 minutes per pound (a 31/2-pound fryer takes 35 minutes). Use tongs to rotate the chicken halfway through to ensure even cooking.
						<br><br>Near the end of the cooking time, get a large bowl of ice water ready and set it near the stove. Use tongs to remove the chicken from the pot and plunge it in the ice water. Turn the chicken to expose it to the cold water. Drain and place the chicken on a plate. Let it cool completely before slicing. Leave it at room temperature if serving soon, or cover it in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Bring it to room temperature before cutting.
						<br><br>3. Meanwhile, add the fish sauce to the broth. Boil the broth until it has reduced by one-third, or until its flavor has concentrated enough for your taste. Turn off the heat and, skim the fat - reserving it for cooking the rice. Strain the broth into another pan. Discard the solids. Cover and set aside while the chicken cools.
						<br><br>4. For the rice, rinse the rice and let it drain for 10 minutes in a mesh strainer positioned over a bowl. Meanwhile, bring the stock to a near simmer in a small saucepan, and then cover to keep it hot.
						<br><br>5. In a heavy-bottomed 3-quart saucepan, heat 4 tablespoons of chicken fat over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, ginger and shallot and cook, stirring constantly, until no longer raw smelling, 1 to 2 minutes. Firmly shake the strainer of rice to expel any hidden water, and then add the rice to the pot. Stir constantly with a large spoon until the grains are opaque white and feel light, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat slightly, measure out 2 ½ cups of hot broth and add the broth and expect dramatic boiling. Immediately give the pot a big stir, reduce the heat to medium to simmer, add the pandan leaves, then let the rice simmer vigorous.
						<br><br>Cook the rice for a few minutes, stirring 2 or 3 times, until most of the water has been absorbed and the surface looks glossy and thick; small craters/holes may form too. Decrease the heat to low, cover, and cook for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let it sit for 10 minutes to firm up and finish cooking. Uncover, fluff with chopsticks or a fork, and then cover. Wait 5 minutes before serving. The rice will stay warm for 30 minutes.
						<br><br>6. Make one, two or all of the sauces and set at the table:
						<br><br>For the ginger sauce, put the ginger, oil, salt, and 1 tablespoon of hot chicken poaching broth (take it from the pot) into a small electric mini chopper and process to a fine texture. Taste and add up to 2 more tablespoons of poaching broth. Transfer to a dipping sauce dish.
						<br><br>For the Singapore chili sauce, put all of the ingredients, the large red chiles, Thai chiles, garlic Ginger, sugar, salt, lime juice and 1 tablespoon hot chicken poaching broth into a small electric mini chopper and process to a semi-coarse sauce. Transfer to a dipping sauce dish.
						<br><br>For the sweet soy sauce, combine the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and chili sauce in a dipping sauce container, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.
						<br><br>7. To serve, use a sharp knife to detach each wing at the shoulder joint. Separate the two wing sections and use a meat-chopping cleaver to chop them into smaller pieces. (Or, keep them whole.) Arrange them on one large serving plate or two small ones. Remove the breasts and leg and thigh quarters. Cut the meat off the bone and slice it into bite-size pieces. Add them to the serving plate(s) in a nice arrangement, skin side up for a beautiful presentation. (Guests may remove the skin while eating.) Finish by scattering cilantro on top.
						<br><br>Bring the broth to a near boil and taste, adding extra salt if necessary. Strain the broth into a large soup bowl and sprinkle with black pepper. Serve immediately with the chicken, rice, cucumber and tomato slices, and dipping sauces.
						<br><br>You may have guests eat the broth out of a rice bowl and the rice and chicken from a plate, using fork and spoon as primary utensils.

							<br>NOTES
							<br><br>Rigatoni with Brussel Sprouts, Bacon, and Arugula.
							<br><br>To impart the taste of fresh, uncooked garlic to sauteed recipes without leaving bits of sliced or minced garlic in the finished dish, add a smashed garlic clove in the last few minutes of cooking, then remove it before serving. For a greater impact, leave it in longer; take it out quickly if just a hint of garlic is what you’re after.
							<br><br>Serves 6 as a starter or pasta course - 4 as a main course.
							<br><br>INGREDIENTS
							<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp kosher salt
							<br>48 &nbsppieces dried rigatoni (about 4 cups), preferably De Cecco
							<br>3 &nbsp tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
							<br>2 &nbsp tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
							<br>4 &nbsp ounces smoked bacon, cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 3/4 cup)
							<br>10 &nbspounces Brussels sprouts (about 12), trimmed and quartered lengthwise
							<br>2 &nbsp tablespoons unsalted butter
							<br>&nbsp &nbsp kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
							<br>2 &nbsp garlic cloves: 1 thinly sliced, 1 smashed with the side of a chef’s knife and peeled
							<br>2 &nbsp cups chicken stock, preferably homemade
							<br>2¼ &nbspcups grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (about 3 1/2 ounces)
							<br>1 &nbsp lemon, juiced
							<br>¼ &nbsp cup minced fresh herbs, either a mix of flat-leaf parsley, dill, and tarragon, or just parsley
							<br>2 &nbsp cups loosely packed baby arugula, washed and spun dry
							<br>&nbsp &nbsp toasted bread crumbs (see recipe below)
						</div>
						<div class="b">
							<br>METHOD
							<br><br>1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta, give a stir, and cook for 5 minutes. Drain the pasta in a colander, return it to the pot, and toss with the oil. Use right away or spread the pasta out on a rimmed baking sheet to cool, then hold at room temperature for up to 8 hours.
							<br><br>2. Select a wide, heavy, not-to-deep pot that can hold most of the ingredients in a single layer, or close to it. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in the pot over medium heat for a few seconds, just to keep the bacon from sticking when added, then add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. Add the Brussels sprouts and 1 tablespoon of the butter and cook until the bacon is lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes more. Season generally with salt and a few grinds of pepper.
							<br><br>3. Add the parcooked pasta and remaining 1 tablespoon butter and cook, stirring, until the pasta is lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the sliced garlic and 1 cup of the stock. Cover and cook until the pasta has absorbed the stock, 3 to 4 minutes. Add another 1/2 cup stock, cover, and cook until it is reduced and the pasta is cooked through and glazed, stirring in a few more tablespoons of the stock, if necessary, to cause a glaze to form. Stir in the smashed garlic clove, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, 1 1/2 cups of the cheese, the lemon juice, and the herbs. If the pasta seems too dry, stir in a little more stock or water.
							<br><br>4. Remove and discard the smashed garlic clove. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the arugula, just wilting it, about 20 seconds.
							<br><br>5. Divide the rigatoni among six plates (or four as an entree) or wide shallow bowls. Top with remaining cheese and bread crumbs, and serve.
							<br><br>6. To make toasted bread crumbs, preheat oven to 275 degrees. Dice day-old bread and put it in a bowl. (If you don’t have any day-old bread, you can lightly toast bread in a low oven until just hardened.) Grate 1 or 2 garlic cloves, depending on the intensity of flavor desired, into the bowl using a Microplane. Pick the thyme leaves from 2 or 3 sprigs, and add them to the bowl, then drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Spread the bread out on a rimmed baking sheet and bake, shaking occasionally to endure even cooking, until lightly golden, completely dry, and hardened, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and pulse to crumbs, but do not overprocess or they will become sandy. Bread crumbs can be held in an airtight container at room temperature for several weeks.

							<br>METHOD
							<br><br>1. BRINE AND PREPARE. Combine all of the brine ingredients and bring to a boil. Once boiling, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Pour brine into a container large enough to hold both the brine and the chicken. Chill brine in the refrigerator.
							<br><br>2. While the brine is chilling, remove the chicken neck and innards from the cavity, if present. Using a paring knife, cut out the wishbone from the chicken—this will make it easier to carve the chicken. Submerge the chicken in the cold brine and chill in the refrigerator for 8 to 12 hours.

							When done brining, pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Discard the brine.

							TRUSS THE CHICKEN. Cut a piece of kitchen twine about 3 feet long. Tuck the center of the string under the pope’s nose (the small bit of meat at the top of the chicken’s tail end), then wrap around and over the ends of the legs. Cross the twine and slide under each leg to create a figure 8. Pull across and back at the same time to plump the chicken breast and bring the twine all the way around the breasts. As you press into the breast meat with your thumbs at the neck, cross each side of the string under the cut neck bone. Tie a slipknot, then bring each end of the string around a wing to close them to the body. Tie off to finish. Place chicken in a baking sheet or dish and leave uncovered in the refrigerator for two days. Doing so dries out any excess moisture from the chicken skin, allowing it to crisp beautifully during roasting.
							<br><br>5.
							After two days, remove the chicken from the refrigerator and allow to temper to room temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
							<br><br>6.
							PREPARE THE ROOT VEGETABLES. Cut off both ends of the rutabagas. Stand the rutabagas on end and cut away 1⁄8-inch of the tough skin, working from top to bottom. Cut into 3/4-inch wedges.
							<br><br>7.
							Repeat with the turnips, cutting the wedges to match the size of the rutabagas. Cut off the dark green leaves from the top of the leeks. Trim off and discard any darkened outer layers. Trim the root ends, cutting around them on a 45-degree angle.
							<br><br>8.
							Halve the leeks lengthwise and rinse the leeks well under warm water. Scrub the parsnips and carrots, trim, and halve lengthwise.
							<br><br>9.
							Cut the parsnips into wedges similar in size to the other vegetables to ensure even cooking.
							<br><br>10.
							Cut the onion into wedges and leave the potatoes whole.
							<br><br>11.
							Combine all the vegetables in the roasting pan and season with salt. Drizzle clarified butter or canola oil over the vegetables and mix with your hands to coat.
							<br><br>12.
							ROAST THE CHICKEN. Preheat the oven to 475°F. Brush the chicken with clarified butter and season all sides with salt. Make a nest in the center of the vegetables and nestle the chicken in it.
							<br><br>13.
							Roast for 20 to 25 minutes. Reduce the heat to 400°F and roast for an additional 30 to 45 minutes, or until the temperature registers 160°F in the meatiest portions of the bird (the thickest part of the thigh, and under the breast where the thigh meets the breast) and the juices run clear. If necessary, return the bird to the oven for more roasting; check it every 5 minutes.
							<br><br>14.
							Transfer the chicken to a carving board and allow to rest for 20 to 30 minutes.
							<br><br>15.
							Just before serving, set the pan of vegetables over medium heat and reheat the vegetables, turning them to coat with the pan juices.
							<br><br>16.
							Finish with a squeeze of lemon. Carve the chicken into serving pieces, arrange over the vegetables, finish with grey sea salt, and serve.

							<br>NOTES
							<br><br>
							Robertson describes a starter -- a mixture of flour, water, wild yeasts, and bacteria -- as a baker's fingerprint. Making one is simple, but it does require a commitment: Count on feeding and caring for the mixture for three weeks before you start baking.
							<br><br>INGREDIENTS
							<br><br>For the Starter
							<br><br>1135 grams white bread flour
							<br>1135 grams whole-wheat flour
							<br>455 &nbspgrams water (lukewarm)
							<br>150 &nbspgrams water (78 degrees) per feeding
							<br><br>For the Leaven
							<br><br>200 grams water (78 degrees)
							<br><br>For the Dough
							<br><br>750 &nbspgrams water (80 degrees)
							<br>200 &nbspgrams leaven
							<br>900 &nbspgrams white bread flour
							<br>100 &nbspgrams whole-wheat flour
							<br>20 &nbsp grams salt
						</div>
						<div class="b">
							<br>METHOD
							<br><br>1. Make the starter: Mix white bread flour with whole-wheat flour. Place lukewarm water in a medium bowl. Add 315 grams flour blend (reserve remaining flour blend), and mix with your hands until mixture is the consistency of a thick, lump-free batter. Cover with a kitchen towel. Let rest in a cool, dark place until bubbles form around the sides and on the surface, about 2 days. A dark crust may form over the top. Once bubbles form, it is time for the first feeding.
							<br><br>2. With each feeding, remove 75 grams; discard remainder of starter. Feed with 150 grams reserved flour blend and 100 grams warm water. Mix, using your hands, until mixture is the consistency of a thick, lump-free batter. Repeat every 24 hours at the same time of day for 15 to 20 days. Once it ferments predictably (rises and falls throughout the day after feedings), it's time to make the leaven.
							<br><br>3. Make the leaven: The night before you plan to make the dough, discard all but 1 tablespoon of the matured starter. Feed with 200 grams reserved flour blend and the warm water. Cover with a kitchen towel. Let rest in a cool, dark place for 10 to 16 hours. To test leaven's readiness, drop a spoonful into a bowl of room-temperature water. If it sinks, it is not ready and needs more time to ferment and ripen. As it develops, the smell will change from ripe and sour to sweet and pleasantly fermented; when it reaches this stage, it's ready to use.
							<br><br>4. Make the dough: Pour 700 grams warm water into a large mixing bowl. Add 200 grams leaven. Stir to disperse. (Save your leftover leaven; it is now the beginning of a new starter. To keep it alive to make future loaves, continue to feed it as described in step 2.) Add flours, and mix dough with your hands until no bits of dry flour remain. Let rest in a cool, dark place for 35 minutes. Add salt and remaining 50 grams warm water. Fold dough on top of itself to incorporate. Transfer to a medium plastic container or a glass bowl. Cover with kitchen towel. Let rest for 30 minutes.
							<br><br>5. The dough will now begin its first rise (bulk fermentation), to develop flavor and strength. (The rise is temperature sensitive; as a rule, warmer dough ferments faster. Robertson tries to maintain the dough at 78 degrees to 82 degrees to accomplish the bulk fermentation in 3 to 4 hours.)
							<br><br>6. Instead of kneading, Robertson develops the dough through a series of "folds" in the container during bulk fermentation. Fold dough, repeating every 30 minutes for 2 1/2 hours. To do a fold, dip 1 hand in water to prevent sticking. Grab the underside of the dough, stretch it out, and fold it back over itself. Rotate container one-quarter turn, and repeat. Do this 2 or 3 times for each fold. After the 3 hours, the dough should feel aerated and softer, and you will see a 20 to 30 percent increase in volume. If not, continue bulk fermentation for 30 minutes to 1 hour more.
							<br><br>7. Pull dough out of container using a dough spatula. Transfer to a floured surface. Lightly dust dough with flour, and cut into two pieces using dough scraper. Work each piece into a round using scraper and 1 hand. Tension will build as the dough slightly anchors to the surface as you rotate it. By the end, the dough should have a taut, smooth surface.
							<br><br>8. Dust tops of rounds with flour, cover with a kitchen towel, and let rest on the work surface for 20 to 30 minutes. Slip the dough scraper under each to lift it, being careful to maintain the round shape. Flip rounds flour side down.
							<br><br>9. Line 2 medium baskets or bowls with clean kitchen towels; generously dust with flour. Using the dough scraper, transfer each round to a basket, smooth side down, with seam centered and facing up. Let rest at room temperature (75 degrees to 80 degrees), covered with towels for 3 to 4 hours before baking.
							<br><br>10. Bake the bread: Twenty minutes before you are ready to bake the bread, preheat oven to 500 degrees, with rack in lowest position, and warm a 9 1/2-inch round or an 11-inch oval Dutch oven (or a heavy oven-proof pot with a tight-fitting lid).
							<br><br>11. Turn out 1 round into heated Dutch oven (it may stick to towel slightly). Score top twice using a razor blade or a sharp knife. Cover with lid. Return to oven, and reduce oven temperature to 450 degrees. Bake for 20 minutes.
							<br><br>12. Carefully remove lid (a cloud of steam will be released). Bake until crust is deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes more.
							<br><br>13. Transfer loaf to a wire rack. It will feel light and sound hollow when tapped. Let cool.
							<br><br>14. To bake the second loaf, raise oven temperature to 500 degrees, wipe out Dutch oven with a dry kitchen towel, and reheat with lid for 10 minutes. Repeat steps 11 through 13.

						<div class="b">
							<br>METHOD
							<br><br>1. Three days before, combine 10 cups water and all remaining soup ingredients except gelatin in large pot. Bring to boil, spooning off any foam that rises to surface. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until chicken pieces are very soft and beginning to fall apart, adding more water by cupfuls if necessary to keep chicken submerged, about 2 hours 30 minutes.
							<br><br>2. Strain soup; discard solids. Return broth to same pot. Boil until reduced to 2 cups, about 35 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour 3 tablespoons water into small bowl; sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand until gelatin softens. Add to hot broth; stir until gelatin is dissolved. Transfer to 13x9x2-inch glass dish. Cover; refrigerate aspic overnight.
							<br><br>3. Two days before, combine all filling ingredients in large bowl and mix with fork just until blended. Cut aspic into 1/3-inch cubes. Add 1/3 of the aspic cubes to pork mixture; stir gently with wooden spoon just until incorporated. Cover and refrigerate. Return aspic to refrigerator.
							<br><br>4. Mix 1 cup black vinegar, 6 tablespoons soy sauce, and 2 tablespoons fresh ginger strips in small bowl. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.
							<br><br>5. One day prior, line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Place 1 dumpling wrapper on work surface. Spoon 1 very generous teaspoon filling onto center of wrapper, including at least 2 aspic cubes.
