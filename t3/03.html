			<h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
			Attempts to describe aesthetic artefacts through
			informational models have existed at least since the
			late 1950s; but they have not been as successful as
			their proponents expected nor are they popular
			among art scholars because of their (mostly)
			quantitative nature. However, given how information
			technology has deeply shifted every aspect of our
			world, it is fair to ask whether aesthetic value
			continues to be immune to informational
			interpretations. This paper discusses the ideas of the
			late Russian biophysicist, Mikhail Volkenstein
			concerning art and aesthetic value. It contrasts them
			with Max Bense’s ‘information aesthetics’, and with
			contemporary philosophical understandings of
			information. Overall, this paper shows that an
			informational but not necessarily quantitative
			approach serves not only as an effective means to
			describe our interaction with artworks, but also
			contributes to explain why purely quantitative models
			struggle to formalise aesthetic value. Finally, it makes
			the case that adopting an informational outlook helps
			overcome the ‘analogue vs digital’ dichotomy by
			arguing the distinction is epistemological rather than
			ontological, and therefore the two notions need not be
			incompatible.

			<h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
			Recent developments in Information and
			Communication Technologies (ICT) have led to
			profound socio-cultural changes and paradigm shifts.
			The ‘information cycle’ (Floridi, 2010) has become the
			engine of post-industrial societies and information
			itself has turned into a powerful hermeneutical device
			employed by many scientific fields to comprehend
			and explain a myriad of phenomena. Even the
			humanities, a field historically wary of ‘technoscience’,
			have come to embrace ICTs and informational
			approaches through so-called ‘digital humanities’
			institutes and programs. Creative practitioners now
			regularly use computational tools and methods and, in
			the process, are expanding the limits and
			transforming the ‘languages’ of aesthetic practices, as
			well as our wider understanding of art and humantechnology
			relations. Nonetheless, and although
			computational technology is quintessentially
			informational, information-centric analyses of art
			continue to be rare. Arguably, this has to do with the
			fact that information is still regarded by scholars in the
			arts and the humanities as a purely quantitative
			notion. Hence, it is associated with formalisation, and
			systematisation; modes of thinking that are seen as
			threats to art’s strongest features: its intuitive nature
			and its openness to interpretation.

			<p>
			The most well-known attempt to analyse aesthetic
			value through an informational lens was Max Bense
			and Abraham Moles’s ’informational aesthetics’.
			Developed in the late 1950s, this was a
			multidisciplinary approach that mixed George D.
			Birkhoff’s (1933) ‘aesthetic measure’, based on the
			ratio between order and complexity, Claude E.
			Shannon’s (1948) Mathematical Theory of
			Communication, Norbert Wiener’s (1985) Cybernetics
			and Peircean semiotics (see Klütsch, 2012). The
			ultimate goal of information aesthetics was to develop
			a method for objectively measuring aesthetic value,
			thus freeing aesthetic judgements from ‘subjective
			speculation’ (Klütsch, 2012, p. 67). Understandably,
			and despite Modernism’s penchant for rationality (e.g.
			Clement Greenberg’s (1999) comparison between
			medium specificity and the scientific parcelling of
			natural phenomena), this type of engagement with
			artworks was not the most popular within art
			scholarship, even after computational technology
			became fully embraced by artists and other creative
			practitioners. Instead, most contemporary art scholars
			continue to outsource their theoretical frameworks
			and views on computer-generated aesthetic artefacts
			to media studies and other recent fields such as
			software studies.
			<p>
			This paper discusses Mikhail Volkenstein’s (2009)
			characterisation of artworks as ‘integral informational
			systems’. It argues that this informational approach
			offers not only a rich insight to better understand how
			we relate and judge aesthetic artefacts, but also helps
			to clarify why attempts to quantify aesthetic value are
			very unlikely to succeed. The paper begins by
			introducing key aspects of information as understood
			by Shannon’s Mathematical Theory of
			Communication, as well as providing a brief
			description of information aesthetics’ main arguments.
			This is followed by a concise outline of Volkenstein’s
			ideas concerning artistic information and its value. The
			next section then introduces an alternative
			understanding of information, provided by the
			philosophy of information. The discussion begins by
			comparing Volkenstein’s views with information
			aesthetics, before showing why seeing the artwork as
			a system explains the failure of quantitative models to
			fully account for aesthetic value. Finally, the paper
			suggests that by being applicable to all forms of art,
			the informational system approach discussed above
			may help supersede the analogue vs digital
			dichotomy. This paper does not (cannot) deny that
			aesthetics, creativity and artistic pleasure might
			someday be analysed objectively; that is, it does not
			subscribe to any essentialist conception of art. It
			simply shows that trying to quantify what happens
			when we create art amounts to quantifying human
			cognitive abilities; a task which, at the very least,
			would, call for enormous datasets, computational
			power, and algorithmic design way beyond our
			current capabilities.

			<h3>2. UNDERSTANDING INFORMATION</h3>
			The word information from the Latin term in formare,
			is a construction reportedly used by Cicero and Saint
			Augustine when discussing Plato’s Theory of Forms,
			and particularly by Cicero to refer to
			‘“representation[s] implanted in the mind”’ (cited in
			Adriaans & Van Benthem, 2008, p. 8). By the early
			Renaissance, the French word information came to be
			used interchangeably to refer to such things as
			‘”investigation,” “education,” “the act of informing or
			communicating knowledge,” and “intelligence”’
			(Adriaans & Van Benthem, 2008, p. 8). However, by
			the end of the seventeenth century, the original
			technical sense of the word had disappeared, as
			British Empiricists who returned to Platonic sources
			chose instead to use the term ‘idea’ (Adriaans & Van
			Benthem, 2008), from ‘eidos’, the Greek word for
			Platonic Form (Dusek, 2006). It was only in the
			twentieth century that ‘information’ began to recover
			its technical connotation. Harry Nyquist and Ralph
			Hartley, both engineers working separately at Bell
			Laboratories, became interested in the possibility of
			quantifying the transmission of information or
			‘intelligence’ (Byfield, 2008). Their papers, published in
			1928, would serve as the basis for Shannon’s 1948
			landmark work, ‘A Mathematical Theory of
			Communication’ <sup>1</sup> (henceforth MTC), the first
			successful method for describing communication in
			terms of probability, and the stepping-stone for
			contemporary ‘information theory’ <sup>2</sup>.
		</div>
		<div class="text03b" style="margin-top:99%">
			1.<br>The following year (1949) Shannon republished his
			work as a book co-authored with mathematician
			Warren Weaver, under the title ‘The Mathematical
			Theory of Communication’.
			<p>
			2.<br>As Floridi (2004) argues, using this name
			interchangeably for MTC is misleading, since the latter
			is a theory of information without meaning, albeit not
			in the sense of being meaningless, but rather in the
			sense of not yet being meaningful. Therefore, a more
			suitable name would be ‘theory of data
			communication’.
		</div>

		<div></div>
		<div class="text03a">
			<h4>2.1 INFORMATION AS QUANTITY</h4>
			Although usually described as such, MTC is not a
			theory of information. It is rather a statistical
			formalisation of data transmission. And while the
			theory does provide a definition of information (i.e. as
			a measure of the freedom of choice an agent has
			when selecting the contents of a message), it is so
			intentionally narrow as to be hardly useful outside the
			theoretical framework in which it is embedded.
			Oversimplifying, Shannon’s theory is a general
			description of the circumstances governing every
			instance where ‘not-yet-meaningful’ data are
			transmitted (Floridi, 2016), and which are represented
			by computable and interchangeable binary digits, or
			‘bits’. The goal of MTC was not to provide an allencompassing
			account of information, but to
			determine (a) what the ultimate level of data
			compression was and (b) what the ultimate rate of
			data transmission was. In other words, how much
			could the size of a given message be reduced before
			making it unintelligible and how fast could it be
			transmitted. For MTC, ‘information’ does not refer to
			what is actually being said, but instead to what could
			be said (Weaver, 1949) using a given amount of data.
			<p>
			Since MTC was conceived to analyse any instance of
			information exchange in quantitative terms, the model
			had to ignore all the unquantifiable ‘psychological’
			(Byfield, 2008) aspects involved in communication.
			MTC intentionally disregards the semantic value of
			messages and treats information as a mere
			placeholder – in the same manner that a gram and a
			millimetre serve as placeholders – that is, as a ‘raw’
			(Floridi, 2004, p. 51), ‘dimension-less’ (Ben-Naim,
			2008, p. 203) quantity. MTC is fundamentally a model
			of communication limits at the syntactic level,
			concerned exclusively with the transmission of
			information and not with information itself. This means
			MTC has little to say about reception (an aspect of
			communication which is of capital importance to, say,
			media theory). Moreover, MTC does not provide a
			method for measuring information per se but for
			quantifying the amount of ignorance or uncertainty
			erased by a message (Floridi, 2004). In other words,
			Shannon used the quantification of predictability and
			redundancy as a ‘backward way of measuring
			information content’ (Gleick, 2011b, p. 191).
			<p>
			MTC regards communication as a system that is
			neither deterministic nor entirely random, but
			stochastic, meaning that its outputs are the product of
			certain probabilities (Gleick, 2011a, p. 187). Two fair
			dice are an example of a stochastic system since it is
			possible to calculate the probability of getting any
			number between two and twelve at any given throw;
			with seven being always the most probable outcome,
			and with each throw being subject to a certain
			amount of randomness, or ‘entropy’, and probability.
			Conversely two extremely biased dice represent a
			deterministic system, since after a series of throws
			one can be fairly certain of what number will come
			next. Deterministic systems are virtually devoid of
			randomness. Whereas in a totally random system (i.e.
			one that stands in a maximum state of entropy) the
			succession of events shows no discernible pattern on
			which to base future predictions, for there is simply no
			way to calculate the likelihood of any output. For
			MTC, the more unexpected the contents of a
			message the more informative the message is and
			vice versa, the more expected and redundant the less
			informative. Thus, in theory, the higher the
			randomness, the higher the (potential) amount of
			information. In summary, for MTC information
			represents a decrease in uncertainty or, more
			precisely, a reduction in ‘data deficit’ (Floridi, 2004, p.
			47) or ‘ignorance’ (Ben-Naim, 2008) about the state of
			a system or the contents of a message. MTC is a very
			effective model in contexts where semantic value is
			not a priority – e.g. in electronic communications and
			computation, but its suitability diminishes greatly in
			circumstances where meaning is central to the
			analysis, such as in aesthetic practices.

			<h4>2.2 INFORMATION AESTHETICS</h4>
			One of the most well-known attempts to apply MTC’s
			definition of information to the analysis of aesthetic
			artefacts was ‘Information Aesthetics’. This theory’s
			goal was to measure the amount and the quality of
			information present in aesthetic objects and hence
			facilitate their objective and scientific judgment
			(Klütsch, 2012, p. 67). Information aesthetics was
			originally developed by Max Bense and Abraham
			Moles between 1956 and 1958. These two
			researchers were very influential figures in the socalled
			‘Stuttgart School’, a group around which many
			digital art pioneers gravitated. Information aesthetics
			reinterpreted concepts such as ‘process’ and
			‘entropy’ as seen by physics and MTC under Peirce’s
			pragmatic semiotics, and merged them with Birkhoff’s
			‘aesthetic measure’ (1933) conceived as a ratio
			between order and complexity – hence, the lower the
			complexity, the higher the order and the aesthetic
			value. Bense, regarded artworks as signs that could
			be broken down into isolated elements (primitives)
			that could then be treated as the building blocks of
			algorithmic processes (Klütsch, 2012). He imagined
			art as a process of aesthetic production,
			consumption, and criticism whose workings could be
			formalised in terms of an axiomatic system.

Birkhoff's theory of aesthetic measure and its applications to geometric forms to provide systematic means of analysis in simple formal aesthetic domains. Source: Birkhoff, G.D., 1933. Aesthetic Measure. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusettes.</i>
			<p>
			The key assumption information aesthetics made – or
			at least that Bense made – was that creative
			processes generally produce order (Rigau, Feixas &
			Sbert, 2008) or ‘negative entropy’ out of disorder. This
			idea is closely connected to Boltzmann’s identification
			of entropy with disorder (Ben-Naim, 2007, p. 196).
			According to this interpretation, physical processes
			tend to change from initial more ordered states,
			towards a state of maximum entropy or ‘“mixupness”’
			– as described by the polymath J. W. Gibbs
			(Ben-Naim, 2007, p. 198), a key figure in the
			development of statistical mechanics. Thus, as Bense
			saw it, while the physical world is inevitably poised
			towards chaos (i.e. to a state of maximum entropy),
			aesthetic creation strives towards order or
			‘negentropy’ (see Klütsch, 2012). It is in the relation
			between chaos/complexity and order that aesthetic
			value lies; and for Bense this framework has the
			status of a natural law. The aesthetic object has
			special properties that go beyond its material carriage;
			a ‘correality’ that is determined by ‘macroaesthetic
			rules’ which may be interpreted and modelled through
			objective algorithmic processes. By surrendering
			subjective interpretation, Bense and Moles’s not only
			gave up on aesthetics as ‘a theory of sensual
			perception’ (Nake, 2012) but also on the notion that
			‘the subject matter of aesthetics is in itself intrinsically
			subjective’ (Cohen et al., 2012).

			<h3>3. THE ARTWORK AS AN INTEGRAL INFORMATIONAL SYSTEM</h3>
			In the last chapter of his (2009) book, Entropy and
			Information, the late Russian biophysicist Mikhail
			Volkenstein offers an informational interpretation of
			aesthetic value. The core premise of his model is that
			creating art involves generating new and irreplaceable
			information. In other words, that artistic creation
			implies ‘the fixing, the committing to memory, of
			random choices’ (Volkenstein, 2009, p. 186).
			Artworks thus may be regarded as non-isolated
			‘integral informational systems’ that not only comprise
			but – most importantly – also further generate new
			information. They are non-isolated because once
			entering the world, artworks acquire a life of their own,
			potentially interacting with an audience while
			maintaining a linkage with their creators. Artworks are
			integral systems because – as happens with living
			organisms – all their features are indispensable for
			proper functioning, and even the slightest change in
			their internal structure can potentially alter their whole
			meaning. That is why a single word in a poem can
			potentially downgrade a masterpiece to tackiness.
		</div>
		<div class="text03b"></div>

		<div></div>
		<div class="text03a">
			<h4>3.1 CREATING NEW AESTHETIC INFORMATION</h4>
			Because every artwork is open for interpretation,
			every person is entitled to say whether they like it or
			not. Nonetheless, a competent and serious judgment
			calls for the observer to have a ‘thesaurus’
			(Volkenstein, 2009, p. 188), that is, certain
			background knowledge, aesthetic sensibility, and
			willingness to interpret the artistic information being
			conveyed. That is why the receptor effectively plays
			the role of co-creator of the piece. Furthermore,
			reception of artistic information involves both a partial
			loss as well as an ‘enhancement’ of information, just
			like every instance of communication is potentially
			subjected to the interference of noise <sup>3</sup>, originated in the physical and environmental conditions
			surrounding the transmission. Given the
			unsurmountable gap between the mind of the artist
			and the minds of her audience, a certain amount of
			information conveyed by her artwork is bound to
			dissipate in the process of being received. For
			Volkenstein (2009, p. 187) such loss is ‘inevitable’ and
			‘trivial’. What is not trivial is the fact that the artwork
			‘activates or programs [emphasis added] a stream of
			associations, thoughts, and feelings in the
			consciousness of the receptor’ (Volkenstein, 2009, p.
			188) stimulating the creation of new information by
			him or her. In summary, according to Volkenstein, the
			true value of an artwork resides not in the object itself
			but in what it brings about in the audience engaging
			with it.
		</div>
		<div class="text03b" style="margin-top:100%">
			3.<br>That is, ‘unwanted data’ (Floridi, 2016) received
			along with a message and with the potential to
			impede its adequate apprehension.
		</div>

		<div></div>
		<div class="text03a">
			<h4>3.2 THE VALUE OF ARTISTIC INFORMATION</h4>
			For Volkenstein, the value of the information
			generated by an artwork depends largely but not
			exclusively on its singularity and irreplaceability. The
			more novel and unexpected the information a given
			artwork generates – i.e. the less redundant it is – the
			more valuable it will be. But regarding this point
			Volkenstein (2009, p. 188) notes an important caveat:
			whereas for MTC redundancy is normally equated to
			low informativeness, in the context of art the
			equivalency cannot stand, since many artworks use
			repetition precisely as an aesthetic device. Therefore,
			a truly redundant and uninformative artwork will be so
			on the basis of cliché and banality, or because it
			merely stands out due to technical prowess.
			Volkenstein thus generalises: the value of a work of art
			may be seen as directly proportional to the novelty
			and unexpectedness of the information it conveys.
			Nevertheless, however indispensable newness might
			be, it is not a sufficient condition for the emergence of
			artistic value. This is illustrated by the fact that a given
			artwork might simply be a derivative and or mediocre
			exemplar of an already established genre, thus it
			cannot generate valuable information beyond its own
			‘matter of factness’. A true artwork needs to not only
			convey, but also stimulate the production of new
			information.
			<p>
			Volkenstein is aware that aesthetic judgements do not
			happen in a vacuum, but that artworks are interpreted
			according to fluctuating tastes and socio-cultural
			norms. Reception of artistic information is both a
			collective and a personal matter subjected to historical
			and psychological changes. That is why yesterday’s
			mediocrity may become today’s masterpiece and vice
			versa. The timeless masterpiece is thus the artwork to
			which we ’return’ repeatedly over the course of our
			lives and that always seems to offer something new;
			true ‘genius’, as Volkenstein (2009, p. 190) argues, ‘is
			unlimited informativity’.
			<p>
			Volkenstein describes art as a process that creates
			order out of a primeval chaos, but also as a peculiar
			form of knowledge of the world. He sees entropy as
			directly opposed but also indispensable for the
			emergence of art; since it is precisely a lack of
			uniformity which allows the poietic ‘negative entropy’
			to emerge and be noticed. Contrary to more fatalistic
			interpretations of entropy, Volkenstein sees this
			phenomenon as an imperative condition for life since
			without it there would be no movement, no
			transference, and no change.

			<h3>4. BEYOND INFORMATION AS A QUANTITY</h3>
			<h4>4.1 INFORMATION AS SEMANTIC CONTENT</h4>
			The very reason MTC is such an effective tool for
			information technologies (namely, its disregard for
			semantic content) makes it comparatively limited
			within the humanities. Quantitative models neglect
			granular detail and individual cases because operating
			at a higher level of abstraction allows them to explain
			phenomena in more general terms. Science, after all,
			is about compressing the largest amount of
			information about any given phenomena into the
			shortest and simplest explanation <sup>4</sup>. In the context of
			art, however, the assumption is that every artwork
			represents a unique irreplaceable instance, even
			though it may share some qualities (physical or
			otherwise) with other exemplars of its class. When we
			approach works of art, we do it with a hermeneutical
			intent attuned to granular detail. Hence, the question
			is what benefits does it have to talk about art in terms
			of information when the very formulation of this
			concept seems to ignore its most crucial aspects? –
			namely, semantic content and its reception. Luckily,
			as Shannon (1980) himself recognised, MTC’s
			reductive characterisation of information is by no
			means the only one available.

		<div class="text03b" style="margin-top: 300px">
			4.<br>Richard Feynman’s often cited explanation of the
			value the atomic theory would have in the aftermath of
			an apocalyptic event that obliterated all human
			knowledge is a good example of this notion (see
			Gleick, 2011a).
		</div>

		<div></div>
		<div class="text03a">
			<h4>4.2 THE GENERAL DEFINITION OF INFORMATION</h4>
			Most fields related to information science now tend to
			agree upon an operational definition of information
			based on semantic content (Floridi, 2011b). According
			to this ‘General Definition of Information’ (GDI)
			semantic contents may be considered information if,
			and only if they are composed of ‘well-formed
			meaningful data’ <sup>5</sup> (see Floridi, 2004; Floridi 2011b).
			Along with rejecting the possibility of data-less
			information, GDI requires data to have some form of
			representation (e.g. binary digits) and also – given the
			nature of current computational technology – physical
			implementation <sup>6</sup>. Now, regarding the question of
			how or why data can carry meaning in the first place
			is, according to Floridi (2004), one of the most difficult
			problems for semantics and human cognition in
			general. Nonetheless, it is possible to bypass this
			problem by assuming the issue ‘is not how but
			whether data constituting information as semantic
			content can be meaningful independently of an
			informee’ (Floridi, 2004, p. 45). Examples such as the
			Rosetta Stone <sup>7</sup> and the growth rings in tree trunks
			show the answer is that meaning is not – at least not
			exclusively – in the mind of the human subject (Floridi,
			2004).
			<h4>4.3 TWO TYPES OF SEMANTIC INFORMATION</h4>
			Understood as semantic content, information comes
			in two major flavours: instructional and factual.
			Instructional information – also known as ‘imperative’
			information – is the kind one might find in stipulations,
			orders, recipes or algorithms. These instances have a
			semantic dimension, since they have to be
			interpretable and therefore meaningful, but unlike
			instances of factual information, they cannot be
			correctly qualified in terms of falsehood or truth, only
			perhaps as being correct or incorrect <sup>8</sup>. Instructional
			information does not convey specific facts nor does it
			model, describe or represent ideas; it merely helps to
			‘bring about’ (Floridi, 2016) (factual) information. For
			its part, factual information (also known as
			‘declarative’ information) is the most important of the
			two kinds of semantic content, but it is also the most
			common way in which information in the capacity of
			information ‘can be said’ (Floridi, 2004). Factual
			information ‘tells the informee [agent] something
			about something else’ (Floridi, 2004, p. 45); for
			example, the location of a place, the time of the day,
			an idea, a fact, etc. To borrow a metaphor from Floridi
			(2004), factual information is like the ‘capital’ or centre
			of the ‘informational archipelagos’, since it provides
			both a clear commonsensical grasp of what
			information is, while linking all other concepts related
			to information.

		</div>
		<div class="text03b" style="margin-top:250px">
			5.<br>The definition of ‘data’ is itself contentious. Data is
			the Latin translation of the Greek word, dedomena; it
			is the utmost unit to which information may be
			reduced. In its singular form, ‘datum’, is a fact
			concerning some difference or lack of uniformity
			within some context, e.g. the perceptible difference
			between two letters in the alphabet, or the difference
			between the presence or absence of an object (see
			Floridi, 2004, 2011b). That is why information is
			sometimes characterised as ‘a difference that makes
			a difference’ (see Byfield, 2008).
			<p>
			6.<br>It is important to note, however, that physicality
			does not necessarily entail materiality (see Floridi,
			2010).
			<p>
			7.<br>Prior to its discovery, Egyptian hieroglyphics were
			indecipherable; the discovery of the stone provided an
			‘interface’ to access their meaning; this however did
			not affect their original semantics (see Floridi, 2004).
			<p>
			8.<br>Consider for example a musical score or a piece of
			software, neither of them may be successfully
			qualified in alethic (truth or falsehood) terms.

			<h3>5. DISCUSSION</h3>
			<h4>5.1 TWO INFORMATIONAL MODELS</h4>
			Volkenstein, like Birkhoff, saw order and complexity as
			oppositional terms, but drew a diametrically distinct
			interpretation out of their relationship. For Birkhoff,
			orderliness meant intelligibility, which translated into a
			better grasp of the intrinsic aesthetic structure and
			value of the artwork by the audience. By the same
			token, complexity obscured order and diminished
			intelligibility. For his part, Volkenstein understood
			complexity as a matter of encoding. Following
			Kolmogorov, Chaitin, and Martin-Löf, Volkenstein saw
			complexity as the size of the smallest program
			needed to describe every one of the features of a
			given object (Volkenstein, 2009, p. 182). The more
			complex the object, the more complex the description
			it requires, and therefore the higher the amount of
			information present in it. Conversely, the more
			structured or ordered – and hence knowable and
			expected – an object is, the lower its complexity and
			informational size. It follows that under this definition –
			and in accordance with MTC – maximum complexity
			is equivalent to maximum randomness. However,
			Volkenstein notes two important caveats: (a) from a
			descriptive or taxonomic standpoint, complexity is not
			a fixed quality, but something relative to one’s level of
			observation; and (b) due to Gödel’s incompleteness
			theorem, there is no logical way to prove
			mathematically that a given program/description of an
			object is in fact the minimal one.
			<p>
			To illustrate the relativity of complexity, we can – as
			Volkenstein (2009, p. 82) suggests – think of the way
			a biologist and a butcher regard a bull’s brain: while
			the former sees a complex system whose minimal
			detailed specification might require a few millions of
			bits, the latter sees but one of the couple dozen
			edible parts of the animal. Similarly, while the word
			‘cat’ would take up some twenty-four bits, a picture of
			a cat might need a few thousand bits, and a (high
			definition) video of the same cat up to a few million
			bytes. It follows that, for the time being, encoding the
			complete specification of that particular cat – or any
			other organism – in a program shorter than the actual
			specimen (Volkenstein, 2009, p. 183) is unlikely, to
			say the least; otherwise, we would be living inside a
			Borgesian fantasy. Hence, it is safe to say that at least
			in the former sense every organism in our known
			world is irreplaceable.
			<p>
			This conception of irreplaceability also applies to
			artificial objects and, in particular, to works of art.
			Though it is possible to manipulate and even duplicate
			certain kinds of artworks, as Volkenstein (2009, p.
			183) argues, it is impossible to devise a minimal
			program for something like Anna Karenina without
			affecting its overall integrity. Abridging an artwork is by
			definition a reduction of its informational content and,
			according to Volkenstein, of its aesthetic integrity and
			value. Complexity is a matter of structure while
			irreplaceability, seen in terms of informational value,
			has to do with added functionality (see Volkenstein,
			2009, p. 184). To our photographically sensible eyes,
			a hyperrealistic painting may be structurally almost as
			complex in terms of informational size as the ‘real-life’
			scene it has encoded, but in truth it contains little new
			information beyond the factuality of its own existence.
			For Volkenstein, this type of mimetic art does not say
			something new and unexpected about something
			else (its referent), but merely displays the technical skill
			of its maker. Under Volkenstein’s framework, it is the
			fact that we learn and do something else with
			whatever we grasp from an artwork – i.e. that we
			‘create new information’ – that truly determines its
			artistic value. It is not orderliness and recognised
			formal patterns that are aesthetically pleasing, but the
			delight of acquiring new, unexpected, and useful
			knowledge about something in the world.
			<p>
			Volkenstein describes artworks structurally as
			complex integral informational systems, but
			functionally as programs that, upon being read, trigger
			the generation of information that did not previously
			exist within them. This metaphor allows us to imagine
			our relation with art in a more contemporary manner.
			We may describe the artwork as a ‘bootstrap loader’
			that launches our ‘thesaurus’, thereby allowing us to
			generate ideas and connections that we could not
			have conceived otherwise. We may also think of an
			artwork not as a pre-compiled program, but more like
			a complex ‘script’ that may be run through a myriad
			of interpreters and produce an equally different
			number of outputs. These could include value
			judgements ranging from a total lack of interest to
			considering the artwork a true masterpiece.
			Nonetheless, like all metaphors, this one also has
			limits. Unlike computers, our interpreting abilities are
			not limited to performing numerical calculations and
			remembering their results; we humans establish
			complex semantic associations without even trying.
			As interpreters, we not always consciously ‘choose’
			which information present in the artwork we pay
			attention to and which we ignore. Our interpretations
			are shaped by our mental and emotional states, by
			our intellectual and personal backgrounds, and by the
			very historical and cultural circumstances surrounding
			our engagement with these and other objects and
			agents in the world.

			<h4>5.2 COMPLEX SYSTEMS</h4>
			Regarding artworks structurally as complex systems
			clarifies why purely quantitative and supposedly
			objective measures of aesthetic value are unlikely to
			succeed, at least for the time being. Complex systems
			are ‘all about information’ (Taleb, 2012), they arise
			whenever a given set of autonomous entities –
			henceforth ’observables’ <sup>9</sup> (Floridi, 2011a) –
			interacting with each other ‘display emergent
			collective properties’ (see Mignonneau & Sommerer,
			2006); and if said properties change over time the
			system is dynamical (Mainzer, 2004). Because they
			are filled with intricate interdependencies which most
			of the time are difficult even to identify, complex
			systems tend to evolve in non-linear fashions; i.e. they
			might change in truly unpredictable ways (Taleb,
			2012). Since the properties of the system are the
			result of the mutual interaction of its components, a
			complex system cannot be analysed by focusing on
			isolated observables, or even on some of the causal
			relationships already known to exist between them.
			Furthermore, the isolated ‘behaviour’ of a system’s
			element might not even reflect back on the general
			ensemble. Complex systems call for a somewhat
			‘ecological thinking’ (Taleb, 2012) since even the
			slightest change or disturbance can potentially alter
			the equilibrium of the entire ensemble. That is why, as
			Volkenstein argued, complex systems are
			(necessarily) integral.
			<p>
			Like complexity itself, specified observables are
			always relative and dependent upon the level of
			analysis employed to analyse them. Being the source
			of information about the system, observables are
			chosen based on the outlook, presumptions,
			theoretical framework, goals and desired granularity of
			the observer. Thus, choosing a given observable
			implies making an ontological commitment – i.e.
			accepting its existence – which, in turn, is supported
			by a larger network of beliefs, knowledge, practices,
			intentions, and instruments (technologies) influencing
			the experience of the observer. This is why the same
			system may be analysed and described through
			different approaches that may or may not share the
			same observables or even the same definition of a
			particular observable – and for that matter, of the
			system as a whole. Hence, observables are not
			universally ‘objective’, some of them may be
			subjective or at least far more dependent on the
			theoretical approach than the observer would like to
			admit. Such is the case with the notions of complexity
			and ‘order’ used by Birkhoff and information
			aesthetics.
			<p>
			Order is a relational as well as a multifactorial
			phenomenon; it does not (cannot) exist in isolation nor
			it is a universal value. Patterns, on the contrary, are far
			more common, pervasive and easier to formalise. As
			noted earlier, information aesthetics sees art as
			something that creates order or ‘negative entropy’
			and, by the same token, sees entropy, and
			randomness as equivalent to disorder. Bense’s
			understanding of the second law of thermodynamics
			aligns with nineteenth century interpretations of
			entropy as a force ushering the world towards a state
			of chaos, uncertainty and dissipation of energy. Along
			with being pessimistic and subjective, this
			interpretation is outright misleading. A far more useful
			way to regard entropy is simply as the tendency of
			systems to assume their most probable configuration
			(see Ben-Naim, 2007); whether such state
			corresponds to ‘disorder’ is a qualitative but not
			quantitative judgement. This interpretation elucidates
			why maximum randomness implies maximum
			informativeness (the absence of a clear-cut pattern
			allows many other patterns to emerge and for more
			information to be chosen), and shows why art is not
			antithetical to entropy. Just as life could not exist
			without motion (Volkenstein, 2009, p. 169) – without
			the transference of energy, chemicals, etc. – patterns
			cannot exist without chaos and randomness. In short,
			entropy and ‘negative entropy’ (i.e., patterns,
			structures, art) are opposite but complementary
			phenomena.
			<p>
			Aesthetic objects are never engaged in vacuo, they
			are, to put it in Volkenstein’s terms, always judged
			against a more or less apt ‘thesaurus’. Art is the
			product of a socio-cultural ‘judgement’ (Nake, 2012,
			p. 74), artworks have no magical intrinsic qualities,
			they are objects that display and convey an intentional
			pattern that generates information. Genres, styles,
			movements, formal qualities, they are all
			epistemological constructs deeply entrenched in
			culture. Art is relational; it arises from the interaction
			between the object-pattern, the audience, and the
			context. The value of an artwork depends as much on
			the way it is in-formed by its creator as on the way it is
			interpreted and judged by the audience. Without
			risking exaggeration, this relational process involves a
			myriad of variables, from perceived technical prowess
			of the artist to the viewer’s own knowledge and
			mental state.
			<p>
			It follows that a true measure of aesthetic value should
			not only account for all the structural elements present
			in any given artwork and for their mutual interactions,
			but also for all the potential contexts and thesauruses
			involved in its interpretation. This of course presumes
			that somebody has found a way to break down an
			artwork into objective minimal units and also figured
			out the rules governing how they are structured and
			interpreted by a human being. Given the intricacy of
			both tasks, it is safe to say that attempting to
			objectively quantify every single one of these variables
			remains an unfeasible task.
			<p>
			<h4>5.3 BEYOND ANALOGUE VS DIGITAL</h4>
			Granting that artworks are informational systems also
			shows the ‘analogue vs digital’ dichotomy is an
			epistemic rather than ontological construction. The
			difference between analogue and digital is one of
			encoding; they are both levels of abstraction but with
			different granularities, they are specifications. Humans
			experience aesthetic artefacts through the same
			sensory apparatus despite their purported ontological
			status; our brains process the information in them just
			the same. The artwork exists as an object because
			we impose a level of observation on it, but at the most
			elemental level what we are always dealing with is
			information. At a fundamental level, information is
			indistinguishable and therefore interchangeable, there
			is no essential difference between one unit and the
			next one, what we identify as the object-artwork is in
			truth a stable pattern, the sum and arrangement of a
			given number of units of information. From this
			epistemological standpoint there is no necessary
			ontological distinction between analogue and digital
			objects. Consequently, this type of informational
			approach is equally useful for traditional aesthetic
			artefacts as it is for their digital counterparts.
			<p>
			Volkenstein shows us that the artwork is ‘telling’ us
			something we did not know, conveying factual
			information, describing something, a certain view of
			the world; in so doing something changes, something
			gets triggered in another system: the viewer’s mind.
			The work of art as a system is open and in flux.
			Information begets information, it is something alive, a
			pattern that is to be constructed. The rarity, the
			unexpectedness of the potential information
			generated is what begets value. The artwork is a
			pretext in the amplest sense of the word; a program
			with uncertain and unlimited outputs. Birkhoff and the
			creators of informational aesthetics understood
			beauty and aesthetic value as something inherent and
			immutable within the object, while Volkenstein shifts
			the value to intuition, to the knowledge that falls
			outside logical proof. For Birkhoff and for informational
			aesthetics, artistic value is to be discovered and
			explained, for Volkenstein, it is to be constructed and
			reimagined. The uniqueness of an artwork is the
			unquantifiable result of an interaction between minds
			and of every potential interpretation that can come out
			of that type of engagement.
			Volkenstein’s two key points: that (a) artworks may be
			regarded as complex systems, and (b) artistic value
			has to do with novelty and irreplaceability but, most of
			all, with (unlimited) informativeness, represents a
			valuable contribution to art scholarship. Volkenstein’s
			model does not enter into contradiction with other
			interpretations of aesthetic value but complements
			them; it does not force us to see or to understand
			artworks just as information, but to see them as
			different configurations, as types of encoding.
			Unlimited informativeness is unlimited interpretability,
			which in turn depends on the individual and its
			context. Each time we run the artwork-program
			through an interpreter we obtain a new iteration of a
			program, which in turn may lead to other programs
			and variations.
			<h4>CONCLUSIONS</h4>
			Regarding artworks as complex systems which, at the
			very least, ‘say something about something else’ does
			not alone explain how or what type of information a
			given artwork might convey; nor does it solve all
			problems presented by aesthetic experience. What it
			does show is that any quantitative model attempting
			to describe aesthetic value is dealing with a complex
			system whose dynamics cannot be reduced to its
			individual components. Artworks are not magical
			objects; regarding them as informational systems
			places them along other complex human processes.
			Demystifying art helps us define what it is without the
			aura of mystery. Art is a very complex (one of the
			most complex) deliberate forms of communication.
			Seeing it as information helps to understand it as a
			communication phenomenon and hence, instead of
			devaluing or reducing it, it helps explaining it.
			<p>
			What has been offered in this paper is not an outright
			negation of the possibility of artworks being analysed
			through quantitative means, but simply an explanation
			of why it is so difficult to do so. Like all complex
			problems, recognising the obstacles goes a long way
			towards finding apt solutions – however modest –
			and, in the process, learning more about our
			methodologies. Seeing artworks through an
			informational perspective can bridge the gap with
			computational interpretations, which in turn may also
			work as metaphors that could promote crossfertilisation
			between programming and art. Finally, we
			have seen the concept of information is by no means
			limited to Shannon’s quantitative characterisation, but
			instead represents a powerful hermeneutical device
			even in the context of the humanities and the arts.
			Moreover, it is now clear that an informational
			characterisation of artworks does not necessarily
			reduce aesthetic experience to a mindless
			computational process. Quite the contrary, this type
			of approach helps to elucidate precisely why art is
			intrinsically open, mutable and rich.
