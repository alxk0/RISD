			Length of time depends upon our ideas.
			<p>
			Size of space hangs upon our sentiments.
			<p>
			For one whose mind is free from care,
			<p>
			A day will outlast the millennium.
			<p>
			For one whose heart is large,
			<p>
			A tiny room is as the space between heaven and earth.<sup>1</sup>

			[P]lace is the product of lived space and lived time, a reflection of our states of mind and heart. In the original Chinese, the above poem ends with the character 間, which in Japanese is pronounced chiefly as ma.
			<p>
			Originally, this character consisted of the pictorial sign for “moon” (月) — not the present-day “sun” (日) — under the sign for “gate” (門). For a Chinese or Japanese using language consciously, this ideogram, depicting a delicate moment of moonlight streaming through a chink in the entranceway, fully expresses the two simultaneous components of a
			sense of place: the objective, given aspect and the subjective, felt aspect.

			The translation of ma as “place” is my own.<sup>2</sup> The dictionaries say “space,” but historically the notion of place precedes our contemporary idea of space as a measurable area. Architectural theorists accept this: “In [our] understanding of nature we…recognize the origin of the concept of space as a system of places.”<sup>3</sup> My translation was selected in part to get away from the rendering of ma as “imaginary space” by Itoh Teiji<sup>4</sup>; this deals only with the subjective aspect, without doing justice to the full spectrum of use and meaning which this venerable character represents.
			<p>			
			It must be stressed that a ‘sense of place’ does not negate an objective awareness of the static or homogenous quality of topological space. Rather, it infuses the objective space with an additional subjective awareness of lived, existential, non-homogenous space. It also incorporates a recognition of the activities which ‘take place’ in a particular space, and different meanings a place might have for various individuals or cultures. “Physical appearance, activities, and meanings are the raw material of the identity of places…” <sup>5</sup>
