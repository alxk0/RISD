			Digitization, it is commonly argued, has liberated our documents from the material limitations of physical media, producing a ‘storage mania’ in which it is easier to accumulate data than delete. The rhetoric of cloud computing has further emphasized the passive accumulation and ‘dematerialization’ of data, by promising to unshackle our documents from the limits of space and time in favour of universal accessibility. However, it would be a mistake to describe the expansion of networked storage, as simply a shift from ‘material archive-systems’ to ‘immaterial information-banks’, as argued by media theorists Joke Brouwer and Arjen Mulder (Brouwer and Mulder 2003, 4). In their work on archives, sociologists Richard Harvey Brown and Beth Davis-Brown state that activities such as acquisition, classification and preservation are ‘technical’ activities associated with the archive that may become explicitly ‘political’ as they determine visibility and access (Brown and Davis-Brown 1998, 18). Far from representing the dematerialisation of the object and the liberation from the archival gaze, digitization presents us with material structures, which raise new questions concerning how social and cultural memory is exploited and ‘read’ by both human and nonhuman actors. As Derrida’s archive fever is supplanted by database fever, technologies of memory are increasingly linked to the industrial processing of information and the performativity of software.

			Framing these shifts has been an ongoing consideration of how the archive might be understood in an age of ubiquitous networked media. In the early noughties, the rhetoric of Web 2.0 celebrated the possibility of shared media, which is both mobile and instant, hosted on storage that is limitless and ‘free’, requiring little technical mastery to publish and share. With the ability to organize content through user-generated tagging systems, the democratic promise of social media appeared to extend the web’s potential to overcome hierarchies of knowledge. Platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Flickr emerged not as ‘guardians’ of digital preservation, but social interfaces which offered opportunities to archive one’s life. By simplifying online publishing, these companies persuaded users to abandon their home pages and migrate to their services with promises of greater storage capacity and convenience, at zero or low cost. However, the economic and technical delivery of this new ‘free’, ‘social’ and ‘archival’ web to millions of concurrent users is far from transparent, and offers new possibilities for the observation and administration of such data. It is clear, then, that when considering the digital archives that characterize web culture today, it is no longer in the context of the ephemeral or ‘virtual limitlessness of cyberspace’, but rather the contingent and specific economies of the server farm or database schema.

			<h2>Database Fever</h2>
			The relational database was first proposed by computer scientist Edgar F. Codd in 1970, and has since become a central, yet largely invisible technology of memory, a container for the blobs of information called videos, documents and snapshots.
			Databases have colonized the back-end of the web: they are the skeletons of search engines; they lie behind social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Wordpress. However, it may not be immediately obvious that the pages that make up the web are increasingly being generated automatically from an underlying database. In the 1990s, establishing a web presence required an FTP program, a few HTML tags and a folder on a web server to store your ‘home.html’. In a post-Web 2.0 environment, authoring has been reconfigured as a process of adding items to the [YouTube/Wordpress] database. The rhetoric of Web 2.0 frames this as a ‘liberatory shift’ in thinking about the web not so much as a set of hyperlinked documents but as a rich interactive platform in which ‘SQL is the new HTML’.1 Observing this ‘database turn’ in relation to YouTube, media theorist Geert Lovink observes: ‘We don’t watch TV any more, we watch databases’ (Lovink 2008, 9).

			A significant consequence of the database-driven web is its dependence on highly efficient and scalable computing platforms—Facebook’s infrastructure alone must serve up to 600,000 images per second. The enterprise data centre or ‘server farm’ has emerged as the contemporary arkheion of Derrida’s Mal d’Archive: a facility for housing tens of thousands of concatenated servers.2 With each site the size of a football pitch and costing anywhere up to $2 billion, these vast air-conditioned bunkers must be strategically located near cheap, abundant electricity; their location is often shrouded with secrecy and access is highly restricted (Markoff and Hansell 2006). And as the paradigm of ‘cloud computing’ increasingly defines the archival web, these information warehouses are being re-branded as liberating ‘clouds’ in which users can relocate their data archives to the Google grid for ubiquitous access.

			When the collection and distribution of media becomes the collection and distribution of data, our photographs, videos and texts become subject to the economics of information production and knowledge management. The database and its attendant technologies (SQL/XML) is also a product of what humanities scholar Alan Liu describes as ‘the new discourse paradigm’ which values ‘the ability to say anything to anyone quickly’ (Liu 2008, 211).3 Liu’s work is significant in identifying the ways in which the development of such standards is informed by the need to make communication as post-industrially efficient as possible to allow knowledge to move seamlessly from print, to web or mobile devices. As Liu observes, the demand that discourse becomes transformable, autonomously mobile and automated is necessary so that ‘a proliferating population of machinic servers, databases, and client programs can participate as cyborgian agents and concatenated Web servers facilitating the processing and reprocessing of knowledge’ (Liu 2008, 216).

			3<br>XML is a set of rules for encoding documents elec-tronically and provides a standard through which disparate data sources (especially from data-bases) can be structured and read Liu 2008, 211.
		</div>

		<div></div>
		<div class="text01">
			Another consequence of standards such as XML is the separation of data from its presentation, which contributes to the mobility of contemporary media and its modularity. Digital media can be processed and circulated increasingly without human intervention; images and texts can be rapidly decontextualized and recontextualized onto different software and hardware. The GPS in your camera will encode each snapshot with the place of capture, your calendar will sync up and confirm the context of your location, a face recognition algorithm will identify and tag the people in the frame before uploading it to Flickr. From there it might be instantly syndicated into the sidebars of blogs or broadcast via RSS to the wireless photo frame sitting on your mother’s mantelpiece seconds after capture.

			With the post-industrial processing of social media, today’s web is not only more ‘real time’ but also more enclosed, searchable and trackable. While there is concern over the control and long-term preservation of this user-generated multimedia archive—broken links, lost webpages, unsearchable content—there is also an increasing sense, that ‘the Internet never forgets’ (Turkle 2011, 260). The ubiquity of digital storage now means it requires more energy to delete rather than save—Google has removed the button to ‘delete’ mail in its mobile Gmail app in favour of an ‘archive’ button. However, the difference now is that data is not just archived: it is automatically (and opaquely) analyzed and shared

			<h2>The Archive as Commodity</h2>
			Whilst database-driven websites are certainly not new, they have emerged as a critical component to the financial success of contemporary social media. In his 2004 article outlining the Web 2.0 paradigm, entrepreneur Tim O’Reilly observed that ‘control over the database has led to market control and outsized financial returns’ (O’Reilly 2005, 3). O’Reilly emphasizes this in his following advice to web developers:

			It’s no longer enough to know how to build a data base-backed web site. If you want to succeed, you need to know how to mine the data that users are adding, both explicitly and as a side-effect of their activity on your site (O’Reilly 2007). 
		</div>

			With greater centralization comes the need for greater computational power and an economic strategy to sustain it. The business model that has emerged and become fetishized by Silicon Valley relies on the extraction of value from ever greater volumes of data. By evaluating the comments, click-throughs, tags, and other content in their databases, companies such as Yahoo, Facebook and Google are able to develop the intelligence of their algorithms and generate wealth from highly targeted advertising. Next to the impact of archives on collective memory and human identity, participation in the digital archive generates another kind of unintentional memory, a ‘data shadow’, which is collected in exchange for free access to these platforms.4  The data mining of our digital selves not only contributes to the commodification of digital memory, but forms part of an economy of association in which transversing the database is mediated by recommender systems which lead us towards certain content above others.
